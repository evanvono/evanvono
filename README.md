- 👋 Hi, I’m @evanvono
- 👀 I’m interested in software development of all kinds.. As you can see from my GitHub, mainly mobile :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development and some cross-platform app tools, and always sharpening up on my favorite native mobile SDKs!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting mobile projects, especially when the scope of what I'm working on is full-stack!
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at evanvono@gmail.com
